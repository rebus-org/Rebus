# Changelog

## < 0.31.0

* Made Rebus - BAM!1

## 0.31.0

* Changed batch API to use `IEnumerable` instead of `params object[]` because the params thing could easily blur which would actually end up as a logical message.

## 0.31.1

* Made Rebus control bus messages `[Serializable]` because for some reason `BinaryFormatter` just likes it that way - applying the attribute makes instances of the class MUCH more serializable.

* Fixed handling of exceptions when committing user-provided unit(s) of work

## 0.32.2

## 0.32.3

* Re-introduced automatic error queue creation when using RabbitMQ

## 0.32.4

* Fixed bug in NLogLoggerFactory that would try to use RebusConfigurer as a logger (?!)

## 0.32.5

* Added ability to customize max retries for specific exception types

## 0.33.0

## 0.34.0
