# Changelog

## < 0.31.0
* Made Rebus - BAM!1

## 0.31.0
* Changed batch API to use `IEnumerable` instead of `params object[]` because the params thing could easily blur which would actually end up as a logical message.

## 0.31.1
* Made Rebus control bus messages `[Serializable]` because for some reason `BinaryFormatter` just likes it that way - applying the attribute makes instances of the class MUCH more serializable.

## 0.32.0
* Updated RabbitMQ client dependency

## 0.32.1
* Fixed handling of exceptions when committing user-provided unit(s) of work

## 0.32.2

* Re-introduced automatic error queue creation when using RabbitMQ

## 0.32.4
* Fixed bug in NLogLoggerFactory that would try to use RebusConfigurer as a logger (?!)

## 0.32.5

* New and improved Azure Service Bus topic-based transport implementation

## 0.34.1

* Fixed bug with RabbitMQ transport that would result in exchange and error queue declaration too early, thus not adhering to customizations made by calling on the Rabbit MQ options

## 0.34.2
* Fixed bug in SQL saga persister and SQL subscription storage because SqlConnection is not nice enough to set the Transaction property when creating commands

## 0.34.3
* Fixed bug in `InMemorySagaPersister` that would not use the proper JSON serializer settings when deserializing

## 0.34.4
* Improved error reporting in case of exceptions while attempting to send all kinds of messages

## 0.34.5
* Added ability to let a special correlation ID header automatically flow to all outgoing messages when it is present

## 0.34.6
* Added ability to provide correlation ID on all outgoing messages automatically in cases where none was supplied from elsewhere ('elsewhere' being either explicitly specified or flowing from the current message context)

## 0.34.7
* Added configuration extension for Log4Net that will automatically set the correlation ID property on the ThreadContext

## 0.35.0
* Made JSON serializer handle encoding properly when deserializing messages

## 0.35.2
* Better handling of errors (i.e. DON'T IGNORE ERRORS) when MSMQ receive fails
* Optimization of SQL Server transport
* Fixed hard-to-find bug in how `SqlServerMessageQueue` would associate commands with the ongoing `SqlTransaction`

* Added transport performance showdown

## 0.35.4
* Only one SQL roundtrip to receive a message
* API to configure whether outgoing RabbitMQ messages should be persistent

## 0.35.5
* Special username header will flow like correlation ID if it is present

## 0.35.6
* Behavior option to allow for impersonating a proper user when the user name header is present on handled messages

## 0.36.0
* Updated Mongo stuff to use 1.8.1 driver and no deprecated APIs

## 0.36.1
* Update Mongo to 1.8.2 because that's the most recent version of the driver... duh!

## 0.37.0
* Added to `SqlServerMessageQueue` the ability to receive messages in prioritized order.

## 0.38.0
* Broke the Log4Net configuration API - sorry! But now it just adds the correlation ID to the thread context by default (i mean, why would you NOT do that?)

## 0.38.1
* Fixed constantly generated warning in timeout manager - thx [hagbarddenstore]

## 0.39.0
* Added ability to compress message bodies as well.

## 0.40.0
* Timeout manager SQL persistence oddity fixed: Explicit bigint PK instead of compound thing that could potentially lead to missed timeouts - thx [krivin]
* `IStartableBus` API extended with the ability to specify number of workers - thx [krivin]

## 0.40.1
* Added ability to use custom encoding with the built-in JSON serializer

## 0.41.0
* Upgraded RabbitMQ client dependency to 3.1

## 0.42.0
* Fixed logging when unit of work commit fails - should always be logged as a USER exception
* Fixed bug where adding custom headers could result in leaking memory in the form of numerous (dead) weak references

## 0.43.0
* Updated RabbitMQ dep to 3.1.5

## 0.43.1
* Rebus now always adds a unique Rebus Transport ID in the headers upon sending a message. This ID will stay the same when message is deferred, forwarded or sent to error queue.
* RabbitMQ transport uses the Rebus Transport ID as it's message ID, if it is not set otherwise
* RabbitMQ transport now initializes the input queue when subscribing - relevant if subscribe is called before receive

## 0.44.0
* Updated Log4Net dependency to 2.0.1 (BEWARE: It appears that the Log4Net public key has changed since previous version!!)
* Azure transport can now be configured in one-way client mode

## 0.44.1
* Avoid warning when disposing one-way Azure transport

## 0.44.2
* Added ability for RabbitMQ transport to NOT create the error queue. This way, the Rebus errorQueue setting just becomes the topic under which failed messages will be published.

## 0.44.3
* Fixed race condition bug when using RabbitMQ auto-delete input queue and subscribing on another thread after having started the bus

## 0.44.4
* Added ability for Azure Service Bus transport to actually use MSMQ when connection string is `UseDevelopmentStorage=true`

## 0.44.5
* Fixed bug where RabbitMQ transport would leak channels when used e.g. in combination with MSMQ in order to "bridge" from a MSMQ bus environment to a RabbitMQ environment

## 0.45.0
* Azure Service Bus transport now automatically creates the error queue

## 0.46.0
* Changed order of operations in MsmqMessageQueue that could lead to using an invalid transaction in rare circumstances
* Made all saga persisters treat `null` as a proper value, thus ensuring that saga data can be inserted, updated, and found with `null` in a correlation property

## 0.47.0
* Use hybrid stash model for transaction context, allowing it to overcome thread discontinuity in ASP.NET and WCF - thanks [jasperdk]
* Optimized data structure for attached headers by doing a hash code-based pre-lookup before searching for `WeakReference` target match

## 0.48.0
* Queue transaction failures are now properly caught and will be waited out when possible
* Increased Azure transport backoff times when throttling is detected

## 0.49.0
* When delivery tracking (i.e. the tracking of message IDs across multiple delivery attempts) times out, a WARN used to be logged. That is now an INFO because this scenario will be very common when running a set of workers as [competing consumers](http://www.eaipatterns.com/CompetingConsumers.html)
* Catch-and-rethrow `TargetInvocationException`s in message dispatch, and do some trickery to preserve the stack trace.
* The new catch-and-rethrow strategy allowed for properly including message IDs in the new `MessageHandleException` which is raised when a message cannot be handled.

## 0.50.0
* Sent messages are no longer logged at INFO level. Both sent and received messages are now logged at DEBUG level by calling ToString on the logical message in a logger called `MessageLogger`
* Dispose MSMQ messages after use - thanks [dev4ce]

## 0.50.1
* Fix that makes changelog 0.50.0 around ToString actually true

## 0.51.0
* Made timeout manager log internal errors properly - first as warnings, and if the problem persists for 1 minute it will be logged as an error
* Removed useless ON [PRIMARY] file group directives from SQL schema generation scripts

## 0.51.1
* Catch exception occurring while attempting to preserve the stack trace of a caught exception inside a `TargetInvocationException`. This will most likely be caused by the absence of a proper exception serialization constructor, which is really dumb -  oh, and thanks to the Unity container crew for making me realize how silly the need for serialization constructors is

## 0.52.0
* Updated NLog to 2.1.0

## 0.53.0
* Azure Service Bus transport: Set MaxDeliveryCount to 1000 to effectively disable built-in dead-lettering (because Rebus handles poison messages)
* Azure Service Bus transport: Peek lock defaults to 5 minutes (which is max)
* Azure Service Bus transport: Make an `Action` available in the message context under the `AzureServiceBusMessageQueue.AzureServiceBusRenewLeaseAction` key to allow for renewing the peek lock when performing long-running operations

## 0.53.1
* Avoid ending up overflowing the stack if `Console.WriteLine` fails

## 0.54.0
* Change `SqlServerSagaPersister` and `SqlServerSubscriptionStorage` to use the same `ConnectionHolder` as `SqlServerMessageQueue`
* Removed the hack that could automatically dig the `SqlTransaction` out of a `SqlConnection` (because it did not work all the time)
* Clean up a few things inside `AzureServiceBusMessageQueue`
* Added test to verify a scenario involving `AzureServiceBusMessageQueue` and `SqlServerSagaPersister`

## 0.54.1
* Nudged order of disposal and logging inside Azure Service Bus transport
* Warning when sending > 90 messages with Azure Service Bus transport + `InvalidOperationException` when > 100 (because of a limitation in Azure Service bus)

## 0.54.3
* `XmlSubscriptionStorage` automatically creates directory pointed to by the subscription XML file path - thanks [hagbarddenstore]
* Made the Rabbit transport throw out its subscription and underlying model when an end-of-stream is detected

## 0.54.4
* Nothing changed - pushed new version because NuGet.org had a seisure the other day and 0.54.3 wasn't properly uploaded

## 0.54.5
* Fixed `SqlServerSubscriptionStorage` to be able to work when publishing within a `TransactionScope` when it manages the connection by itself - thanks [jasperdk]

## 0.54.6
* Added load balancer NuGet package

## 0.54.7
* Fixed logging in load balancer

## 0.54.8
* Made `ConsoleLoggerFactory` public so it can be used e.g. from processes hosting the load balancer

## 0.55.0
* RabbitMQ client updated - thanks [hagbarddenstore]

## 0.55.1
* Fixed Rabbit transport nuspec

## 0.56.0
* Added ability to configure queue polling backoff strategy to low-latency mode - thanks [hagbarddenstore]

## 0.56.1
* Don't make so many DEBUG logging statements while backing off

## 0.57.0
* Tweaked ASB transport so that send batching kicks in only when there's 100 or more messages to send
* Fixed it so that the error log on a tracked message has the local time (i.e. machine time) as its timestamp, and not UTC

## 0.58.0
* Fixed it so that the `MarkedAsComplete` event is raised also when a piece of saga data was never persisted - before, it was tied to the `Deleted` event from the persister, which you not be raised if the saga data was not persistent.
* Made Rebus Timeout Service create a service dependency on local SQL Server/MongoDB if the connection is local. This way, services will be started/stopped in the right order. Thanks [caspertdk]
* Fixed it so that headers attached to deferred messages are preserved when roundtripping the timeout manager.

## 0.58.1
* Added 'CorrelationId' thread-local context variable to NLog logger, similar to how it's done with the Log4Net logger.

## 0.58.2
* Fixed `AttachHeader` bug in `FakeBus`.

## 0.59.0
* Fixed bug when working with automatic `TransactionScope` and sagas persisted in SQL Server - thanks [jasperdk]

## 0.60.0
* Made SQL Server saga persister behave more like expected by skipping null-valued properties in the saga index.

## 0.60.1
* Fixed but in SQL Server saga persister that could result in malformed SQL when there are no correlation properties at all.

## 0.61.0
* Made it configurable whether null-valued correlation properties should be included in the inde with SQL Server saga persister.

## 0.61.1
* Added to RavenDB saga persister the ability to obtain the current session from the outside, thereby allowing you to make the saga work part of the same RavenDB transaction that you're working in.

## 0.62.0
* Fixed leakage of SQL connections (and other potential issues) when using ambient transactions - thanks [mgayeski]

## 0.63.0
* Added several `Subscribe`/`Unsubscribe` overloads to `IRebusRouting` so you can `bus.Advanced.Routing.Subscribe(someMessageType)` if you want

## 0.63.1
* Added file system-based transport. Please do not use this one for your really important messages.
* Fixed MSMQ transaction leak - thanks [jasperdk]

## 0.64.0
* Updated MongoDB driver dependency to 1.9

## 0.64.1
* Added ability to configure JSON serializer to serialize enums with their string representations - thanks [maeserichar]

* Added Postgres persisters for sagas, subscriptions, and timeouts - thanks [hagbarddenstore]

## 0.67.0
* Added ability for RabbitMQ transport to publish to different exchanges instead of different routing keys - thanks [pruiz]
* Limit message body size to 32 MB for RabbitMQ transport because publishing larger messages can destabilize the server.

## 0.69.0
* Removed MSMQ error queue existence check when queue is remote (because it can't be done, and because it doesn't make sense for remote queues)
* Added ability for saga persisters to provide the ability to update more than one saga instance for an incoming message, by implementing `ICanUpdateMultipleSagaDatasAtomically` - thanks [PeteProgrammer]

## 0.70.0
* Made all batch operations obsolete so that you'll get a compiler warning if you use them.

## 0.70.1
* Added container adapter for SimpleInjector - thanks [oguzhaneren]

## 0.70.2
* Fix problem when trying to send Multicast message to error queue - thanks [maeserichar]

## 0.70.3
* Fixed vulnerability that could lead to executing arbitrary SQL statements by injecting it in a correlation property on a saga message when using SQL Server and PostgreSQL saga persisters.

## 0.71.0
* Fixed bug that could result in not automatically binding the error queue topic to the error queue when using RabbitMQ
* Update MongoDB driver dependency to 1.9.2
* Fixed error in build script that did not build the Serilog project. Also fixed it so that Rebus.Serilog is .NET 4 like the rest of Rebus.

## 0.71.1
* Ensure declaration of exchange when using `OneExchangePerType` - thanks [maeserichar]

## 0.71.2
* Fixed SQL Server schema creation issue where querying `sys.tables` would give an error if the database's current collation results in case sensitive table names - thanks [tiipe]

## 0.71.3
* Made SQL Server subscription storage & saga persister API accept connection string names (just like the SQL transport config)  - thanks [tiipe]

## 0.71.4
* Allow for specifying the messages table name on the SQL Server transport - thanks [tiipe]
* Modified SQL server-based persistence things to accept connection string _names_ as well - thanks [tiipe]
* Fixed subtle bug that would not remove the saga context from the current message context's items - thanks [dimajanzen]

## 0.72.0
* Added auditing capability - endpoints can now send a copy of the transport message to an audit queue whenever they have been successfully handled or published (which is the only two times when messages "disappear" - when handling a message, it "disappears", and when publishing to 0 subscribers, it also "disappears"). This can provide the basis for advanced tooling later on, e.g. for tracking correlation across systems, for gathering statistics etc. For now, go audit your messages - more tools will follow :)

## 0.73.0
* Updated RabbitMQ dependency - thanks [maxx1337]
* This version DOES NOT WORK because of the merge bug fixed in 0.75.0

## 0.74.0

## 0.75.0
* Fixed merge bug that made published Rebus core assembly unusable!

## 0.75.1
* Fixed container adapter registration bug that would make it impossible to have `IMessageContext` injected into more than one handler in the pipeline. Also ensures that the container does not dispose the message context.

## 0.75.2
* Change SQL Server subscription storage command to be truly idempotent - thanks [tobiaxor]

## 0.76.0
* Auto-subscribing extension on `IBus` - thanks [seankearon]
* Updated Azure Service Bus dependency to 2.5.4

## 0.77.0
* Improved Serilog integration

## 0.77.1
* Made `PoisonMessageInfo` ctor public so that the `IErrorTracker` can actually be implemented outside of Rebus - thanks [bchavez]

## 0.78.0
* Added extension that allows for composing a chain-of-responsiblity-like way of determining message ownership - thanks [DixonD-git]
* Introduced a little bit of structure in the `Rebus.Extensions` package - might not be the final way, but it should do for now

## 0.78.1
* Added support for DryIoC - thanks [DixonD-git]

## 0.78.2
* Fixed DryIoc nuget package

## 0.79.0
* Changed `IStoreTimeouts` API to return a `DueTimeoutsResult` instead of an `IEnumerable<DueTimeout>`
* Made `SqlServerTimeoutStorage` grab row locks on found due timeouts, allowing for "competing timeout consumers"

## 0.80.0
* Changed default encoding of outgoing messages to be UTF8 instead of UTF7 when using the built-in JSON serializer
* Added `NewtonsoftJsonMessageSerializer` that is honest about its dependency on Newtonsoft JSON.NET and thus lets you customize the serialization settings - thanks [joshua5822]

## 0.80.1
* Support async initiation of sagas via `IAmInitiatedByAsync<>` - thanks [AndreaCuneo]

## 0.81.0
* Support for idempotent sagas via the `Rebus.IdempotentSagas` packages - thanks [pruiz]

## 0.82.1
* Updated Serilog dep - thanks [tiipe]

## 0.83.0
* Fixed concurrent message send in file system transport - thanks [mgibas]

## 0.84.0
* Made Azure Service Bus transport stop the peek lock renewal timer when the transaction context goes into the commit/rollback/cleanup phase. Seems more right, and it avoids a pesky race that could result in confusing `MessageLockLostException`s if the message would happen to be successfully completed right before attempting to renew the peek lock.

## 0.90.0
* Refactored most of Rebus! NOTE: (very) breaking change!! - 0.90.0 version series will function as ALPHA and BETA of what will become Rebus 2.0.0
* Introduced pipelines for message send and receive
* New configuration API based on Injectionist
* Simpler transaction handling, simpler `ITransport` abstration
* Idempotent sagas
* Several new integrations: Jil, Azure Storage Queues, Amazon SQS
* Async to the core! (i.e. remember to `bus.Send(yourMessage).Wait()` if you cannot `await bus.Send(yourMessage)`)
* Routing based on topics - type-based routing ("Rebus Classic") is just a subset of this
* Batching features completely removed
* In-memory transport can be used for in-process communication and testing
* Ground laid for more advanced control of Rebus internals, e.g. to implement auto-scaling of number of workers, diagnostics, etc.
* Tests refactored to make it much much easier to introduce new implementations based on contract tests

## 0.90.1
* Added `TransactionScope` support via the `Rebus.TransactionScope` package (note: requires at least .NET 4.5.1 for `TransactionScopeAsyncFlowOption.Enabled` to be there)

## 0.90.2
* Added ability to storage subscriptions in a JSON file

## 0.90.3
* Added RavenDB persistence for subscriptions and timeouts - thanks [mclausen]

## 0.90.8
* Added pub/sub support to legacy compatibility mode
* Changed `AzureServiceBusTransport` to work with topics when doing pub/sub which then avoids having to configure subscription storage when working with Azure Service Bus


## 0.90.9
* Separated error tracking out behind `IErrorTracker` interface, allowing for e.g. keeping error counts in a database somewhere, thus allowing for multiple parallel workers to not exceed maximum delivery attempts
* Added ability to auto-add headers to outgoing messages by using `[Header("some_headers", "some_value")]`

## 0.91.0
* Changed SQL persistence to work with `IDbConnectionProvider` as originally intended - thanks [MrMDavidson]
* Made Azure Service Bus transport use the native message deferral mechanism
* Made Azure Storage Queues transport use the native message deferral mechanism

## 0.92.0
* Made SQL Server transport use a `visible` field in the database to implement message deferral (warning: schema change)

## 0.92.1
* Fixed RabbitMQ NuGet dependency to explicitly depend on 3.5.4 because silly NuGet will default to the lowest version and that does not play well with strong naming and actually having versions on assemblies

## 0.92.2
* Fixed RabbitMQ transport bug that would create wrong queue bindings - please update to this version :)

## 0.92.3
* Changed `SqlTransport` to use the cryptic `DELETE OUTPUT` style query yielding ~ 10 times performance improvement - thanks [MrMDavidson] for a very well-documented PR :)

## 0.92.4
* Added one-way client mode + appropriate configuration extensions for all transports but Amazon SQS (it requires some more work)

## 0.93.0
* Updated MongoDB driver dependency to 2.0.1 and rewrote MongoDB persistence to take advantage of `async`/`await` - thanks [kevbite]

## 0.94.0
* Made the type-based pub/sub API default and moved the raw string-based topic API into `bus.Advanced.Topics`

## 0.98.2
* Added transport message routing capability

## 0.98.3
* Made disposal of resources more consistent (still not entirely consistent though, depends on importance)

## 0.98.4
* Added `IsNew` property to `Saga` base class allowing saga handlers to easily determine whether the instance is new

## 0.98.5
* Added one-way client mode for Amazon SQS transport

## 0.98.6

## 0.98.7
* Added simple 2nd level retries mechanism
* Added ability to forward the current transport message (optionally supplying some extra headers)
* Added configurable idle time backoff strategy

## 0.98.8
* Fixed bug that could result in double-resolving handler instances with Ninject, Castle Windsor, and Unity because of a lazy-evaluated `IEnumerable`

## 0.98.9
* Fixed MSMQ remote queue path formatting

## 0.98.10
* Extended built-in handler activator with `Register` overloads that allow for registering handler factory functions that accept `IMessageContext` and `(IBus, IMessageContext)` as arguments

## 0.98.11
* Added `IMessageContext.AbortDispatch()` which aborts dispatch of the current message to any handlers following the one currently being executed.

## 0.98.12
* Added ability to mark saga data as unchanged by calling `MarkAsUnchanged()` on the saga handler.

## 0.99.0
* Inject loggers. Will remove static logging things later.
* Allow for enabling partitioning with Azure Service Bus transports
* Changed Azure Service Bus transports to use streams as the message body to avoid silly XML-wrapping - thanks [meyce]
* Updated WindowsAzure.ServiceBus dependency to 3.0.4
* Updated WindowsAzure.Storage dependency to 6.0.0

## 0.99.1

## 0.99.3
* Access to more useful information on `Failed<TMessage>`

## 0.99.4

* Replaced Windsor's assembly-scanning with manual scan

## 0.99.6
* Set correlation ID, content type, and label properties on brokered messages with Azure Service Bus transport

## 0.99.7
* Limit length of header values used when using Azure Service Bus transport

## 0.99.8
* Fixed it so that delivery will not be retried indefinitely on commit exceptions

## 0.99.9
* Changed RabbitMQ routing to use two exchanges: one for direct addressing, and one for pub/sub messaging. This way, "clean" RabbitMQ topics can be subscribed to and then used when publishing, allowing for subscribing to topics using wildcards.

## 0.99.10
* Fixed nuspec on StructureMap package, made SimpleInjector package dependency version criteria more tolerant, and updated the Unity dependency to v 4

## 0.99.11
* Added ability to immediately forward messages on certain exception types (optionally when those exceptions satisfy some predicate)

## 0.99.12
* Added LightInject container adapter - thanks [puzsol]

## 0.99.13
* Added DryIoc container adapter - thanks [dadhi]

## 0.99.14

* Added `IBus` API overloads for `Subscribe` and `Unsubscribe` that accept a `Type` as a parameter - thanks [gertjvr]
* Fixed `ExpiredMessagesCleanup` warning because of locked rows when handling message for a long time with the SQL Server transport
* Introduced `rbs2-defer-recipient` header to designate the queue to deliver the message to when it returns - allows for doing request/reply with a defer in the middle without losing the return address (which must be transferred manually, though, unless you `bus.Advanced.TransportMessage.Defer`)
* Crude attempt at allowing for sagas to resolve their conflicts by overriding `ResolveConflict`

## 0.99.18
* Fixed bug that would fail saga data auditing when the message could not be correlated with a saga data instance

## 0.99.19
* Fixed Rebus' SimpleInjector container adapter registrations to be able to resolve `IMessageContext` as part of the container's verification process

## 0.99.24
* Fixed bug in in-mem saga storage that would accidentally enforce uniqueness of correlation properties across saga data types

* Fixed options configuration API to be more consistent and thus less prone to confusion - thanks [xenoputtss]
* Added experimental unit of work API

## 0.99.26
* Fixed bug in RavenDB saga persister - thanks [bjomi] and [jsvahn]
* Fixed bug in Injectionist that could lead to resolve instances sometimes now being properly initialized/disposed

## 0.99.27
* Added Wire serializer

## 0.99.28
* Automatically set correlation property on newly initiated saga data when possible (we try to do it when there's one single correlation property for the message, and ignore failure to do so)

## 0.99.29

* Enabled true polymorphic correlation

## 0.99.38
* Fixed saga correlation bus introduced in 0.99.37

* Added fallback capability to the router (i.e. the ability to configure an endpoint that is used when none of the mappings match)
* Fixed bug in retry strategy step that could accidentally keep tracked message IDs for too long
* Prohibit sending `IFailed<TMessage>` anywhere (because it is most likely an error)

* Added cancellation support to the `Receive` operation of the transport - thanks [Rzpeg]

## 0.99.60
* Changed data type of the SQL Server saga storage `[data]` column to `VARBINARY(MAX)` because `NVARCHAR(MAX)` was extremely slow! (existing tables with `NVARCHAR(MAX)` data should still work fine - a simple schema check is made at startup)
* Added Azure blobs-based data bus storage

## 0.99.61
* Added ability configure prefetch count with RabbitMQ
* Added a few additional defensive RabbitMQ reconnection measures, like e.g. throw out prefetched messages if the connection is lost

## 0.99.68
* Provide optional Jil configuration `Options` parameter, allowing for customizing serialization settings - thanks [Rzpeg]

## 2.0.0
* This is Rebus 2 :)

## 2.0.1

## 2.1.1
* Add missing Injectionist access methods on `RebusLoggingConfigurer`

* Move Rebus 1 (i.e. versions <= 0.84.0) legacy compatibility feature to separate package: [Rebus.LegacyCompatibility](https://github.com/rebus-org/Rebus.LegacyCompatibility) (no worries: Rebus 2 and 3 can talk just fine!)
* Change transaction context API to be much more intuitive `DefaultTransactionContext` and `DefaultSyncTransactionContext` now automatically make the transaction context ambient
* Removed `GetCurrentClassLogger` because the stack frame walking turned out to be unreliable in the face of what seems to be new, more aggressive method inlining

* Hide some internal types that were never meant to be part of the API
* Add correlation configuration API to make it easy to correlate headers of incoming messages with saga data

* Add routing slips
* Add `DeferLocal` and make deferral work analogous to sending
* Add ability to forcibly limit the length of the `rbs2-error-details` header to overcome limitations of the transport in cases where e.g. a long stack trace would make it impossible to forward a failed message to the error queue

* Fix exceptions thrown by default persistence implementations
* Fix exception thrown by Injectionist if a resolver cannot be found

## 4.1.0
* Add optional in-process locking middleware for saga instances
* Force initialization of the configuration system at startup to avoid risking that it is initialized in a Rebus handler (almost always triggered by Entity Framework, results in exceptions complaining that Rebus' transaction context contains unserializable things)

## 4.2.1
* Re-publish 4.2.0 because the Rebus.dll generated in 4.2.0 had version 1.0.0 and not the correct version

## 4.2.2
* Remove `.ConfigureAwait(false)` throughout, because it messes up the ability to carry ambient contexts into callbacks, which (via decorators) is one of Rebus' most important extensibility points - thanks [oliverhanappi]

## 4.3.0
* Add methods to in-mem persistence providers, making it easier to inspect them e.g. when testing - thanks [oliverhanappi]

## 5.0.0
* Move entire `Rebus.Testing` namespace to its own NuGet package: `Rebus.TestHelpers` (named "TestHelpers" to avoid confusing it with Rebus' own test project, and just because it's more appropriate)
* Ensure disposal of all `IDisposable` instances tracked by Injectionist in the event that an `IInitializable` fails during startup
* Add option to omit type information from serialized JSON text, thus saving lots of space and making the serialized JSON more pure at the expense of .NET object serialization power

* Ability to "name the bus", allowing for using something more descriptive than the default "Rebus 1", "Rebus 2"S names
* Change built-in console logging to use abbr. log lvls.

## 5.0.2
* Add count methods form `InMemNetwork` - thanks [caspertdk]

## 5.3.1
* Fix bug in the "enforce exclusive saga access" feature that would result in an exception, if the same lock bucket got hit more than once

## 5.4.0
* Add `rbs2-defer-count` header, which is initially set to 1 when a message is deferred - each subsequent deferral of the message will then increment this counter

## 5.4.1
* Fix bug that would erroneously return a not-so-useful message context when inside a `RebusTransactionScope`

## 6.0.0
* Move data bus configuration to main configurer, so now you can go `.DataBus(d => d.StoreInFileSystem(@"\\network-path\folder"))`
* Add automatic claim check support, so you can have big messages transferred as data bus attachments by going e.g. `d.SendBigMessagesAsAttachments(bodySizeThresholdBytes: 200*1000)`
* Move cancellation support into the backoff strategy - thanks [nativenolde]
* Change log messages when changing number of workers to include the bus name - thanks [nativenolde]

## 6.0.1
* Make file system transport compatible with previous versions of Rebus - thanks [jr01]

## 6.6.5
* Fix transaction context bug that would result in the completed flag being incorrectly set in situations where completion failed, which could lead to abort handlers not being called as they should

## 6.7.0

## 7.0.0
* Change locking interface to be more generic - thanks [kendallb]
* Only target .NET Standard 2.0
* Change default JSON serializer to System.Text.Json (this is a BREAKING change! Please remember to `.Serializer(s => s.UseNewtonsoftJson()))` if you rely on e.g. inheritance and other advanced stuff
* Add `Configure.OneWayClient()` API which can be used to configure one-way clients, because handlers - and thus also the handler activator - are irrelevant - thanks [riezebosch]

## 7.2.0
* Add `Events` configuration method on `OptionsConfigurer` to provide easier access to `BusLifetimeEvents`

## 8.0.1
* Change the sequence of events in the retry step, which paves the way for true, distributed error tracking (i.e. tracking delivery attempts across nodes)
* Refactor transaction context to make distinction between the ACK/NACK protocol and commit/rollback actions more clear
* Change error tracking to use `ExceptionInfo` instead of real `Exception`s to provide support for distributed error tracking
* Introduce `.Errors(e => ...)` configurer as a hook for configuring custom error trackers
* Add `IExceptionLogger` responsible for logging exceptions to enable consistent exception logging regardless of which error tracker is configured
* Prevent multiple bus instances from enlisting in the same transaction context, because it will result in undefined behavior
* Update accepted version range for System.Text.Json to include 8 and start with 6 (because 5 has dependency on lib reported as vulnerable)
* Update Newtonsoft.JSON accepted version to start at 13 because 12 is considered vulnerable

## 8.0.2

* Add optional `rbs2-delivery-count` header, which may be provided by transports that are capable of counting deliveries natively

## 8.2.4
* Fix behavior of fail-fast combined with 2nd level retries to be like before (i.e. failing fast will immediately trigger 2nd level retry)

## 8.3.0
* Alter how the message transaction context is managed when dead-lettering (i.e. the failing message context is now passed to `IErrorHandler` - it is now up to the error handler to create its own scope if it so desires) - thanks [AndreaCuneo]

## 8.4.0
* Add .NET 6 as compilation target to enable stripping dependencies that are included in the BCL - thanks [thompson-tomo]
 
## 8.4.1

## 8.4.2
* Fix bug that would prevent using a default return address on a one-way client

## 8.4.3
* Fix bug in `EnforceExclusiveSagaAccessIncomingStepBase` that would cause lock buckets to be picked in an unstable way (in modern .NET, at least). Now using custom-implemented stable hash based on MD5

## 8.4.4
* Flatten hierarchy when looking up the dispatch method to better enable extension/alteration by inheritance - thanks [X509Whatever]

## 8.5.0
