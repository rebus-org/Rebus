# Changelog

## < 0.31.0

* Made Rebus - BAM!1

## 0.31.0

* Changed batch API to use `IEnumerable` instead of `params object[]` because the params thing could easily blur which would actually end up as a logical message.

## 0.31.1

* Made Rebus control bus messages `[Serializable]` because for some reason `BinaryFormatter` just likes it that way - applying the attribute makes instances of the class MUCH more serializable.

## 0.32.0

* Updated RabbitMQ client dependency

## 0.32.1

* Fixed handling of exceptions when committing user-provided unit(s) of work

## 0.32.2

* IEnumerable/Add API on SagaFixture
* SQL index on saga_id in saga index table

## 0.32.3

* Re-introduced automatic error queue creation when using RabbitMQ

## 0.32.4

* Fixed bug in NLogLoggerFactory that would try to use RebusConfigurer as a logger (?!)

## 0.32.5

* Added ability to customize max retries for specific exception types

## 0.33.0

* Removed (default) transaction scope around message handlers, made it configurable with `.Behavior(b => b.HandleMessagesInsideTransactionScope())`
* Added hybrid saga persister that can use different concrete persisters depending on the type of saga data

## 0.34.0

* Added (finally!) an icon for NuGet to display along with all Rebus packages
* New and improved Azure Service Bus topic-based transport implementation

## 0.34.1

* Better error handling when deferring messages
* Fixed bug with RabbitMQ transport that would result in exchange and error queue declaration too early, thus not adhering to customizations made by calling on the Rabbit MQ options

## 0.34.2

* Fixed bug in SQL saga persister and SQL subscription storage because SqlConnection is not nice enough to set the Transaction property when creating commands

## 0.34.3

* Fixed bug in `InMemorySagaPersister` that would not use the proper JSON serializer settings when deserializing

## 0.34.4

* Improved error reporting in case of exceptions while attempting to send all kinds of messages
