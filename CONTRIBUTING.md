## Contributions are most welcome! :)

I do prefer it if we communicate a little bit before you send PRs, though.
This is because _I value your time_, and it would be a shame if you spent time
working on something that could be made better in another way, or wasn't
actually needed because what you wanted to achieve could be done better in
another way, etc.

## "Beginners"

Contributions are ALSO very welcome if you consider yourself a beginner
at open source. Everyone has to start somewhere, right?

Here's how you would ideally do it if you were to contribute to Rebus:

* Pick an [issue](https://github.com/rebus-org/Rebus/issues) you're interested in doing,
  or dream up something yourself that you feel is missing.
* If you talk to me first (either via comments on the issue or by email), I
  will guarantee that your contribution is accepted.
* Send me a "pull request" (which is how you make contributions on GitHub)

### Here's how you create a pull request/PR

* Fork Rebus ([Fork A Repo @ GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/))
* Clone your fork ([Cloning A Repository @ GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/))
* Make changes to your local copy (e.g. `git commit -am"bam!!!11"` - check [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository) out for more info)
* Push your local changes to your fork ([Pushing To A Remote @ GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/))
* Send me a pull request ([Using Pull Requests @ GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/))

When you do this, your changes become visible to me. I can then review it, and we can discuss
each line of code if necessary.

If you push additional changes to your fork during this process,
the changes become immediately available in the pull request.

When all is good, I accept your PR by merging it, and then you're (even more) awesome!
